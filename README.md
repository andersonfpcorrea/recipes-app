# _[Forkify](https://recipes-app-andersonfpcorrea.netlify.app/)_

This _[app](https://recipes-app-andersonfpcorrea.netlify.app/)_ is inspired by the _[final project](https://forkify-v2.netlify.app/)_ of _[Jonas Schmedtmann's](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann)_ JavaScript course.

My Forkify app is being built with Vite, React, TypeScript and SASS.

Initially I will consume data from _[spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/)_, but the goal is to implement the app's own API.

# My to do list:

## Front-end

- Authentication:
  - [ ] Create a component for handling "forgot password";
  - [ ] Create a component for "Sign up"
  - [ ] Create a componenet for signing up with social network accounts
- App pages/components:
  - [ ] Create a Header with user name, gravatar and a search bar
  - [ ] Create a SearchBar page that renders by default previous search results
  - [ ] Create a main view component to render recipes according to categories
  - [ ] Create a "new recipes" component to render newly added recipes (cards with name, photo, rating, author and duration)
  - [ ] Create a Footer containing 5 icons: home, bookmarks, upload new recipe, notifications and profile

## Back-end

- Implemenent RESTFul API using Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose and MongoDB.
