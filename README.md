# _[Forkify](https://recipes-app-andersonfpcorrea.netlify.app/)_

This recipes app is being built with Vite, React, TypeScript and SASS.

Data are consumed from _[spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/)_, _[mealdb](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)_, and _[REST Countries](https://restcountries.com/#rest-countries)_.

The _[app](https://recipes-app-andersonfpcorrea.netlify.app/)_ was inspired by the _[final project](https://forkify-v2.netlify.app/)_ of _[Jonas Schmedtmann's](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann)_ JavaScript course.
