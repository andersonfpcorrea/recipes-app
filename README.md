# Description

This project is going to be a recipes app. Click _[here](https://recipes-app-andersonfpcorrea.netlify.app/)_ to check the progress so far.

Data are consumed from _[spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/)_, _[mealdb](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)_, and _[REST Countries](https://restcountries.com/#rest-countries)_.

## Project setup

- TypeScript v.4.6.4
- React v.18.2.0
- React Router v.6.3.0
- SASS v.1.54.7
- Vite v.3.0.7
- ESLint v.8.23.0
- StyleLint v.14.11.0

The app was inspired on the _[final project](https://forkify-v2.netlify.app/)_ of _[Jonas Schmedtmann's](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann)_ JavaScript course, on which I learned all the fundamentals aspects of JavaScript. My goal is to extend that initial project, creating a nice looking, responsive, scalable and functional app.
